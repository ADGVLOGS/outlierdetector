# outlierdetector
C# Outlier Detector to detect outliers in databases converted to a csv format.
You may change up this program to suit your needs or fix the UI.

# Usage
Please do not go into the folders (i made a oopsie by posting the old version of the code). 
Download the 7zip file and extract (all the source code and .exe is present there). 

# Information and guidelines
Can read nth fields.

for the program to understand data it should be in this format.
name,name,.....    
data,data,.....  
data,data,.....  

in other words name is the column name
data is your raw whole integers if i have time in the future to modify the program i will change the array to double to read decimal points.

# errors in the program
IQR, Q1,Q2,Q3 values are rounded off
therefore 
Outlier range is a little off.
but the program is quite accurate to point out outliers.
